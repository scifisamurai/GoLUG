1. A brief summary of the business / site goals.
Attract new and experienced people with an interest in the GNU/Linux Operating
System.  The main goal is to interest users into attending our
meetings. Some sub goals are to convince users to get in contact with other GoLUG
members, learn what GoLUG is all about, and maintain a history of
presentations (past & future).

2. The key users:
New users that don't know anything about Linux,experienced users that know a
ton already about Linux, intermediate users that know some things about Linux.
All of the above users may also already know about GoLUG while others do not.

3. Scenarios in which your app or site will be used:
I expect certain users (regardless of experience) to come to the site just to find
out information about the next meeting.  I expect other users to not know much about GoLUG 
or Linux and will want to know more and/or if it's something worth their time.  
Some other users will already know about Linux and will be interested 
in finding other like minded individuals.  


4. Design principles to follow:
Balance, hierarchy, emphasis, white space
